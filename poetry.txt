Can I call you yard to yet.
and believe you too can fly.
The sadness of a humming bird's bet,
is that you both know why. 
When two bodies meet in space,
they pass or they collide.
But I suspect the darkness smiles,
when say reveal where an orbit hides.
Water in a faucet,
like poetry on the mind.
Hope is there when you turn a tap,
but the source has been refined.
The most beautiful colors of a painting,
a universe or pun.
Where sometimes we find are two,
there was only room for one.
Know how just like piano keys,
I love to hear your news.
So saddest part of your worthy notes,
one time and just one choose.
When silence comment's on a situation,
it provokes no reaction.
The hardest heart in the deepest despair,
surely needs that traction.
Of all my highly scary things,
culture scares the most to me.
Never been known to heed red lights,
is the subtlety that stampeeds.
No point in naming clouds,
why didn't you tell me sooner.
They pass by fast like eyes of strangers,
named not once we fewned her.
A research grant for curly phone cords,
that's what this world needs.
Find out where oh tangles come from,
to go where art that leads.
I always know when I'm in love,
like trees a desert lends.
I thought I saw you twice today,
of course it always ends.
A snail appears so slow,
but oh how fast it is.
To take from life at such a rate,
and just as fast it gives.
